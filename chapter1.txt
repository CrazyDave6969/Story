A journey so charming, a path with trials to face,
You a bit distant, I a touch farther from grace.
Yet within this distance, I'm in need of your trace,
When my eyes finally open, me you'll embrace.

In the beginning, it's how these things start,
Even if later, you might fade from my heart.
The meaning of promises, we learn as we part,
Once a friend close, now drifted apart.

No farewells were spoken, I'm lost in the way,
Today you are here, tomorrow, who's to say?
Still, a cloud of sadness envelopes my day,
Why, despite the change, does this feeling stay?

As the present unfolds in its intricate scheme,
A melody of emotions, like verses in a dream.
I'll hold onto the memories, each one a gleam,
In this ever-evolving tale, life's unpredictable stream.
